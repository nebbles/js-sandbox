This inverse kinematics snippet is derived work from [a Coding Challenge by D. Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbgDqyy8bIw). His challenge was written in Java. This project translates much of this theory into javascript utilising the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) framework, a wrapper to HTML5 canvas functionality.
