# Evo Snakes

Evo Snakes is a original work created on the 14 July 2019. It uses the p5js framework, a wrapper to HTML5 canvas functionality. 

The idea came to merge two earlier projects, Evo Bugs & Inverse Kinematics, into a singlular simulation. The inspiration for this work came from examples made by D.Shiffman (The Coding Train on YouTube).

The majority of this implementation however, is original work.
