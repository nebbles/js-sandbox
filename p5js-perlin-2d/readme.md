# Perlin 2D

[![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?label=View&message=demo&color=f7df1f&style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript)](https://nebbles.github.io/js-sandbox/p5js-perlin-2d)

This visualisation is built based on the [introduction to Perlin Noise by D. Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf4dIN99e2w). It is built with an underlying flow field, directionality controlled by perlin noise (changing over time) which then directs particles to draw over the canvas. This project utilises the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) framework, a wrapper to HTML5 canvas functionality.
